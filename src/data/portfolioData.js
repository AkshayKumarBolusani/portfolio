    <h2>Volunteering at Telugu AI Bootcamp 2.0 Graduation</h2>
    <p>On July 26th, 2025, I had the privilege of volunteering at the <strong>Telugu AI Bootcamp 2.0 Graduation</strong> hosted by <strong>DigiPreneur</strong> at <strong>T-Hub, Hyderabad</strong>. It wasn‚Äôt just an event‚Äîit was the culmination of a revolutionary learning experience that empowered hundreds of learners across Andhra Pradesh and Telangana to explore Artificial Intelligence in their mother tongue, Telugu.</p>
    
    <h3>About Telugu AI Bootcamp 2.0</h3>
    <p>Telugu AI Bootcamp 2.0 is <strong>India‚Äôs first fully hands-on AI program delivered 100% in Telugu</strong>. Spanning over 50 days, it brought AI concepts closer to regional language speakers‚Äîstudents, professionals, housewives, freelancers, entrepreneurs, and teachers‚Äîeliminating all language barriers and making tech accessible to all.</p>
    
    <h3>What Makes It Unique?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>100% in Telugu</strong> ‚Äì no translations, no confusion</li>
      <li><strong>Beginner-Friendly</strong> ‚Äì no tech background needed</li>
      <li><strong>Practical & Powerful</strong> ‚Äì real-world tools, real tasks</li>
      <li><strong>Over 100 AI Tools</strong> taught through guided learning</li>
      <li><strong>Live & Recorded</strong> sessions (6‚Äì7:30 AM / 7:30‚Äì9 PM IST)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Bootcamp Curriculum Highlights</h3>
    <p>Each week was a deep dive into new themes, blending AI with creativity, business, and digital empowerment:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Week 1:</strong> Growth Mindset, AI Fundamentals, Productivity, Branding</li>
      <li><strong>Week 2:</strong> Website/App Building, Publishing, Social Media, Advertising</li>
      <li><strong>Week 3:</strong> YouTube Automation, Business Networking, Freelancing</li>
    </ul>
    
    <blockquote>
      ‚ÄúLearn It, Use It, Own It‚Äù ‚Äì The guiding mantra of Telugu AI Bootcamp 2.0.
    </blockquote>

    <h3>My Volunteering Experience</h3>
    <p>As a volunteer, I helped coordinate sessions, guided attendees, and assisted organizers throughout the graduation ceremony. The energy was electric‚Äîseeing learners proudly showcase their AI-driven projects in Telugu was both inspiring and emotional.</p>
    
    <p>I met passionate individuals who had never touched a line of code before this bootcamp, now confidently building tools, publishing books, and designing brand identities‚Äîthanks to the bootcamp‚Äôs structured and inclusive approach.</p>
    
    <h3>Additional Program Highlights</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>21-Day AI Challenge:</strong> One task every day to build AI mastery</li>
      <li><strong>8 Power Sessions:</strong> Live mentor-led sessions with demos, case studies, and actionable business insights</li>
      <li><strong>100k+ worth of bonuses</strong> including templates, lifetime access, and portfolios</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Who Was It For?</h3>
    <p>This program was open to everyone‚Äî<strong>students, homemakers, freelancers, job seekers, business owners</strong>‚Äîproving that AI isn‚Äôt just for coders, but for every curious mind with a dream.</p>

    <h3>Final Reflections</h3>
    <p>The Telugu AI Bootcamp 2.0 is more than a course‚Äîit‚Äôs a movement. As a volunteer, I witnessed the real impact of inclusive tech education. I left the event deeply inspired and more motivated than ever to contribute to the tech-for-all movement in my community.</p>

    <p>Special thanks to DigiPreneur and T-Hub for making this vision a reality. I‚Äôm proud to have been part of this milestone in regional tech empowerment.</p>
